This unit focuses on big data processing, including volume, complexity, and velocity using the latest big data technologies. In big data volume, it covers large volume data processing using parallel technologies. In large dimensionality (or complexity), it covers various data analytics methods for parallel processing. For the velocity, it covers data streaming processing.


- Hadoop Ecosystem and Applications
- Big Data Processing Concepts and Technologies
- NoSQL on documents and graphs, and introductory distributed graph processing
- Data streams, streaming algorithms, and distributed computations
- Advanced topics in Big Data: machine learning and cluster performance measurement
