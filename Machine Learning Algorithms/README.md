# Machine Learning for Weather Forecasting

Predicting rain or weather is a common problem in machine learning. Different machine learning algorithms can be used to model and predict rainfall. In this project we make a complete analysis to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not. We apply tools of machine learning to visualize and predict the possibility of rainfall in Australia.

## Description

`Weather Forecasting.ipynb:` In this notebook we perform tasks related to data exploration, cleasing and transformation in order to further apply different machine learning algorithms, make meaningful predictions and compare results. To understand model performance/accuracy we use confusion matrices and calculate `Precision`, `recall`, and `F1 score`  of each algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset is originally from Kaggle Dataset and can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). It has been modified to serve our purpose i.e. (to do the binary classification).
